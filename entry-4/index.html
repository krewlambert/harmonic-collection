          the world sprinted out<br>
          of death<br><br>
          and the sky opened up<br><br>
          big and gorgeous<br><br>
          spilling into me until<br><br>
          I was<br><br>
          so very tiny and<br><br>
          outside of myself<br><br>
          a promise of birds<br><br>
          streaked across heaven’s<br><br>
          underbelly<br><br>
          the body can be a home<br><br>
          and nothing can touch me

      <strong>
      Do you remember how much fun we had <br>
      playing in the bellies of beached whales? <br>
      during early march whole pods would wash ashore millions incalculable <br>
      Do you remember how cold the water was then? we used to knock our fists along their chests <br>
      until we found we were running out of rib <br>
      and you would find the perfect spot to cut us-sized holes right below the sternum <br>
      With that big knife you stole from your dad while he slept his thumbs <br>
      without halfmoon— <br>
      Just in case you told me <br>
      Though I only ever saw you use it to open portals <br>
      Do you remember how bright it was in those heavy bodies?

  <strong>
  I’ve been told about a hill
<br>
covered with thousands of unbroken, wild ponies
<br>
I have yet to find it
<br>
God knows I’ve searched
<br>
Maybe I’ve passed it on the highway without knowing,
<br>
red knuckled
<br>
With the calm of steer
<br>
We tend to limp around the nucleus
<br>
Holding on to dog-toothed marginalia
<br>
sprawled across
<br>
sidewalk chalk residuals dissolved,
<br>
wet with sky
