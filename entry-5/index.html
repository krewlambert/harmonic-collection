    <p><em>I sat down in the middle of the middle couch in the middle row around 8:05; you were next to me. 
    You had short brown hair and I think a knit sweater vest. I was wearing a white tank top. 
    You were engrossed in the film (among the greatest of all time!), but I think we might have exchanged 
    some glances as we all exited. I left with a friend and couldn’t find a way to say hello...</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Maybe we could observe time passing together?</strong></em></p>

      <p><strong>Describe your recollection of the events. What stood out to you when you saw her?</strong><br>
      Oh, hmm... well are you familiar with the clock?</p>

      <p><strong>Is it a piece at the MoMA?</strong><br>
      Yeah. Well I guess it was the last night of the installation, and it was really crowded... 
      I thought she had a cool energy. We stayed until they kicked us out.</p>

      <p>So then I was curious about who I was sitting next to. Then they came and told us, 
      “Times up at the clock.” Everyone was leaving and I thought she was very cute, 
      but more importantly, she had an interesting energy.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p><strong>What made you think to post it on Craigslist?</strong><br>
      Oh, I read a lot of Craigslist... I just love to look. (laughs)</p>

      <p><strong>Is this something you’ve done before?</strong><br>
      I’ve never posted. I’ve met a few penpals and helped someone with an art project, 
      so I guess I’ve replied a lot.</p>

      <p><strong>Did she end up finding the post?</strong><br>
      Yeah, almost immediately — I think I posted it late at night and she found it the next morning. 
      She said someone she knew sent it to her who’s a big Craigslist reader. 
      Either that, or she is one herself. People are on those pages all the time.</p>

      <p><strong>So how did you know that it was her for sure?</strong><br>
      I just trusted that it was her. But also, if you email via the Craigslist relay using your 
      personal email address, it will show your full name. She sent her name as 
      “via Anonymous Craigslist user.”</p>

      <p><strong> Are you going to meet her? </strong><br>
      <p>Yea i guess we are going to Chelsea Piers later this week. We are going to have a picnic, classy like that. </p>

      <p><strong>Good luck man, wish you the best. </strong></p>
      <p> Thanks, I need to figure out what I'm going to bring. </p>
